# This script acts as a router to the current workflow. As the project
# evolves and new collections or workflows are added, this file should
# be updated to reflect the current process. The goal is to always be
# able to run ./scripts/main and have it do the right thing.
#
# Current workflow:
#   Import photos from Lightroom exports directly into the favorites
#   collection (portfolio). This ingests photos, adds them to favorites,
#   generates metadata, and syncs to R2.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/main
